## Usage

To use AI-CodeWise, add this GitHub Actions workflow to your repositories

```yaml
name: Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: read
    steps:
      - name: Harden Runner
        uses: step-security/harden-runner@128a63446a954579617e875aaab7d2978154e969 # v2.4.0
        with:
          disable-sudo: true
          egress-policy: block
          allowed-endpoints: >
            api.github.com:443

      - name: Code Review
        uses: step-security/ai-codewise@v1
```

When you create a pull request in the repository, the workflow will get triggered and add a pull request comment. The comment will be added even if the pull request is from a fork. Here is an screenshot of what the comment will look like:
